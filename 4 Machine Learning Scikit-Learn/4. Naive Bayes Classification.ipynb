    "2. They provide **straightforward probabilistic prediction**\n",

    "These **advantages** mean a naive Bayesian classifier is often **a good choice** as **an initial baseline classification**. If it performs suitably, then congratulations: you have a very fast, very interpretable classifier for your problem. If it does not perform well, then you can begin exploring more sophisticated models, with some baseline knowledge of how well they should perform."

This means that clusters in high dimensions tend to be more separated, on average, than clusters in low dimensions, assuming the new dimensions actually add information. For this reason, **simplistic classifiers** like naive Bayes tend to work as well or better than more complicated classifiers as the dimensionality grows: once you have enough data, even a simple model can be very powerful."
